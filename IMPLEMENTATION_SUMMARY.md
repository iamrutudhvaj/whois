# WHOIS Project Implementation Summary

## Overview

The WHOIS project has been successfully set up with the following components:

1. **README.md**: Comprehensive documentation on how to set up and run the project.
2. **API_KEY_GUIDE.md**: Detailed instructions on obtaining and configuring a WHOIS API key.
3. **.gitignore** files: Properly configured for the project root, backend, and frontend.
4. **Frontend configuration**: Updated to run on port 5000 as required.
5. **Backend configuration**: Set to run on port 8000 as required.

## Key Features Implemented

### Backend (FastAPI)

- RESTful API for WHOIS lookups
- Domain and contact information extraction
- Error handling and response formatting
- Environment variable configuration
- CORS middleware for frontend communication

### Frontend (React)

- User-friendly interface with Tailwind CSS
- Domain and contact information display
- Error handling and loading states
- API integration with Axios
- Responsive design

## Configuration

- Backend runs on: http://localhost:8000
- Frontend runs on: http://localhost:5000
- Environment variables are loaded from `.env` file in the backend directory

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Run the included test_api.py script to verify backend functionality.
2. **API Key**: Obtain a WHOIS API key as described in API_KEY_GUIDE.md.
3. **Deployment**: Consider containerizing the application for easier deployment.

## Notes

- The frontend is configured to communicate with the backend at http://localhost:8000
- The API key must be set in the .env file for the backend to function properly
- Both frontend and backend include proper error handling for a robust user experience
